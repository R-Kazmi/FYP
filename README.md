# fyp-project

This is my final year project that i did for Bachelor in Software Engineering. The purpose of this project is to create a unique system for online-streaming platforms users, so that they can enjoy all from one system with some new, dedicated easy to use features. It will be used to enjoy different categories of
entertainment in one place. This system will contain allthe features of digital entertainment. People
can watch different events together, organize watch parties, can keep track of what's going on in
the entertainment world, create and share playlists and watchlists, review their favorite films and
series, make new friends based on similar interests, talk about their favorite shows and so on. It will
have supported platforms to watch in sync. Suggestion engine to bring the same interested people
together. It will have dedicated tabs for all the major categories of entertainment. People
can organize watch parties with the support of live chats, create playlists and watch lists, share their
reviews of the films, albums, and takes on sports events. People can see what their friends are
interested in. They can communicate and talk about their interests.
