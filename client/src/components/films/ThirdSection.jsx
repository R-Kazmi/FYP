            anything&mdash;I guess that&rsquo;s hard to quantify&mdash;is my own
            going to therapy. That space, what you talk about, what that&rsquo;s
            all about, that whole history of how you came to feel the way you
            feel. All the things that led to you interpreting the world in this
            way, both in a way that you can talk about, and in an unconscious
            way that you can&rsquo;t really talk about. That&rsquo;s my movie
            terrain, you know? Feelings, your interior life, what people call
            mental health, or the spectrum of mentality&mdash;let&rsquo;s call
            it that&mdash;that&rsquo;s my turf. That&rsquo;s my genre. Feelings
            are my genre".&nbsp;
